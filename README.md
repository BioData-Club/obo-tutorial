# OBO Tutorial (for OHSU BioData Club)

The [Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO)](http://obofoundry.org) provide a suite of high-quality, interoperable, free and open source tools for sharing scientific knowledge and making new discoveries.

This tutorial reflects the lessons that the tutorial's developer, [James Overton](https://github.com/jamesaoverton), learned using OBO ontologies to work with scientific data. You'll learn how to use OBO ontologies to communicate more clearly, to integrate data, and to improve search and analysis.  This version of the tutorial has been modified by [Marijane White](https://github.com/marijane) of the [OHSU Library](https://library.ohsu.edu) for use in the Better BioData ontology workshop hosted by [OHSU's BioData Club](https://biodata-club.github.io/).

We use a single running example to keep things concrete: a spreadsheet of data about histology observations. Starting with this data, we build an application ontology, transform the data into [linked data](http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data), and then apply an automated reasoner and query over it. All using open source code and tools.
